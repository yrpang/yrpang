I am a second-year master's student at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2022. I am also a member of [Microsoft Student Ambassador](https://mvp.microsoft.com/zh-CN/studentambassadors/profile/71db62fa-5eed-4ee3-a7d9-8e1ec228c72f). My primary research focus lies in data center networking, encompassing congestion control, network function acceleration using eBPF and DPDK, and smart NICs based on FPGA. In my spare time, I am a web developer, with experience in Next.js, Node.js and Django frameworks.
