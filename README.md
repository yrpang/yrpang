### Hi there, I am [yrPang](https://yrpang.com). 👋

 ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=yrpang.yrpang)

I am a Backend Engineer at TikTok.
I obtained my master's degree from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2025 and my bachelor's degree from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2022.

During my academic research, I focused on data center networking, including congestion control, network function acceleration using eBPF and DPDK, and smart NICs based on FPGA.

In my spare time, I'm passionate about building AI applications. I enjoy full-stack development with Next.js and Go.
